# Welcome to Commons Stack

We build ****commons tech, changing tragedy into festival by realigning incentives.

## Problem definition

Funding of a public good \(TE research as an example\). Open Source TE Research Creates Uncaptured Value. ****This is a common issue in the open source world, known as the [Free-rider Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem).

* Because of this, the rigorous design and validation of proposed cryptoeconomic models is happening in different silos and common procedures are not yet clear nor easily shared. There is no incentive to share the tools.
* The R&D going into building these tools is a long, complex and expensive process, and creating the documentation and educational resources required to spread their use is an additional expense with little reward.
* Coordinating the many organizations that are doing this research is difficult but necessary so that they can build off of each otherâ€™s ideas and establish standards and best practices.
* There are many projects working to ameliorate the issues surrounding open source development, and we think this framework can aid cross project collaboration. Among a few are SourceCred, other examples?

## User Stories / Fund Requester \(Farmer\)

### Sign in or create a ethereum account

â€¦ this should be glossed over in our narrative...

### Create campaigns

* Setup ETH wallet \(Metamask/mobile\)
* Create a campaign
  * Pic
  * Title, description \(e.g. Plant Oaks in Indonesia\)
  * Reviewer
* Create milestone
  * Pic
  * Title, description \(e.g. Plant 10 Oaks by 01.06.19\)
  * Amount requested \(Fixed amount, e.g. 100 xDAI\)
  * Reviewer 

If somebody else donates to the milestone, the amount is reduced.

### Track progress of the campaign

* See my campaigns/statuses
* Get email notification when my campaigns got funded
* See funds before the transfer
  * 10 xDAI from external donors
  * 90 xDAI from the Commons

### Redeem funds after approval

* If it triggers I get 10 xDAI and some commons token \(the equivalent of 90 xDAI\)
* The user gets directed to Team 1 UI for bonding curve, so he can burn tokens for DAI.

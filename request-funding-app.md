## User Stories / Fund Requester \(Farmer\)

### Sign in or create a ethereum account

â€¦ this should be glossed over in our narrative...

### Create campaigns

* Setup ETH wallet \(Metamask/mobile\)
* Create a campaign
  * Pic
  * Title, description \(e.g. Plant Oaks in Indonesia\)
  * Reviewer
* Create milestone

  * Title, description \(e.g. Plant 10 Oaks by 01.06.19\)
  * Amount requested \(Fixed amount, e.g. 100 xDAI\)
  * Reviewer

\*For the hackathon we launch a separate Giveth entity, and we have a DAC that shows all milestones that can go to Momentum voting module. So people there can stake tokens to put it to the list.  


If somebody else donates to the milestone, the amount is reduced.

### Track progress of the campaign

* See my campaigns/statuses
* Get email notification when my campaigns got funded
* See funds before the transfer
  * 10 xDAI from external donors
  * 90 xDAI from the Commons

### Redeem funds after approval

* If it triggers I get 10 xDAI and some commons token \(the equivalent of 90 xDAI\)
* The user gets directed to Team 1 UI for bonding curve, so he can burn tokens for DAI.
